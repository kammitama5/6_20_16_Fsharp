# 6_20_16_Fsharp
learning a bit of F#
So I'm a part of this AWESOME Haskell group, and 
we also do a bit of Elm/F# and other such languages in between
to see the differences between them. Tonight we're doing F#.
I've never tried F# before, so I thought I'd get a little brush up
before attending this evening's event.
